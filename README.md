# CUBE ROS messages

This repository contains ROS messages for the CUBE V2X ecosystem.
These messages are part of the public API and maintained by [nfiniity](https://www.nfiniity.com).

## Where are the nodes?

The CUBE ROS nodes are bundled with the CUBE SDK shipped with our devices.
However, you interact with a CUBE even without the SDK using the ROS
messages in this repository.
