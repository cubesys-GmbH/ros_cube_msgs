# cube_ttc_msgs

This package contains the ROS2 IDL files used by cube_ttc, the Time-To-Collision calculation package of cube-its.

Currently, this package is a *preview*! We may change types, names and semantics at any time.
Feel free to experiment with cube_ttc and cube_ttc_msgs but be prepared that your code might break!
